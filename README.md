# NL Portal

![License EUPL 1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-EUPL%201.2-blue)

NL Portal is an open-source application for communicating with citizens and third parties, built for
use with the Dutch 'VNG API's voor Zaakgericht Werken' and based on Common Ground principles. Under
the motto 'create once, use 340 times', any (government) organization can use and improve it freely.

This is the NL Portal **monorepo**: the backend, frontend, local development stack and documentation
live together and release at a single, shared version.

## Running NL Portal

Three ways, by purpose - see [GETTING_STARTED.md](./GETTING_STARTED.md) for the commands:

- **Remote** - run the published images to evaluate the product (no build).
- **Local** - build and run your changes as they'd ship.
- **From sources** - run the backend/frontend from your IDE for fast development.

For deployment, see the [documentation](https://nl-portal.nl) and the helm-charts repository.

## Developing

Each stack has its own README with setup, build and run instructions:

- Backend: [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md)
- Frontend: [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md)
- Local supporting services: [docker-compose/README.md](./docker-compose/README.md)
