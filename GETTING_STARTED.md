# Getting started

NL Portal can be run three ways, each for a different purpose. All of them use the
[`docker-compose/`](./docker-compose/README.md) stack for the supporting services (Keycloak,
databases, ZGW). Pick the mode that matches what you are doing; each links to the fuller docs.

## 1. Remote — evaluate the released product

Pull the published images and run them; no build. For demos and evaluation.

```shell
cd docker-compose
RUN_MODE=remote docker compose --profile zgw --profile haalcentraal up -d
```

The portal is at http://localhost:3000. See
[docker-compose/README.md](./docker-compose/README.md#remote-published-images) for profiles, image
tags and test-user credentials.

## 2. Local — run your changes as they'd ship

Build the backend and frontend images from this monorepo and run them containerized. For verifying
a change end-to-end in its shipped form: the image build, runtime configuration, and customization
such as theme, logo or feature toggles.

```shell
cd docker-compose
RUN_MODE=local docker compose --profile zgw --profile haalcentraal up -d --build
```

See [docker-compose/README.md](./docker-compose/README.md#local-build-from-source).

## 3. From sources (active development, fast inner loop)

Run only the supporting services in compose, and run the backend and frontend yourself for fast
reload. `sources` is the default `RUN_MODE`, so the supporting stack leaves the app ports
(`8080`/`8000`/`3000`) free for your locally-run app; no `RUN_MODE` needs to be set.

```shell
# supporting services only (app ports left free)
cd docker-compose
docker compose --profile zgw up -d
```

There are two app pairs you can run against that stack. Pick by what you are working on.

### Feature work: the dev apps (default)

The developer-only "dev" apps carry long-lived work-in-progress features (currently the producten /
thema demo). They run from sources only and are never published or imaged. This is the recommended
inner loop: the backend dev app enables every module with GraphQL introspection on, so it exposes the
full schema and is the recommended target for `pnpm --filter @nl-portal/nl-portal-api codegen`.

```shell
# backend dev app: no .env.properties, configured from its own application.yml
cd backend && ./gradlew :app-dev:bootRun

# frontend dev app on :3000: libraries in watch plus the dev app's vite dev server
cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

The thema/producten demo is data-driven, so log in as the demo user BSN `999993847` to see its themas.
See [backend/app-dev/README.md](./backend/app-dev/README.md) and
[frontend/packages/app-dev/README.md](./frontend/packages/app-dev/README.md).

### The shippable app from sources

To run the production-shaped apps instead (no producten/thema demo, openproduct off), for example to
reproduce something against the app that actually ships, use the `:app` backend and the `app:`-prefixed
frontend scripts:

```shell
# backend shippable app: needs .env.properties (copy from .env.properties.example)
cd backend && ./gradlew :app:bootRun

# frontend shippable app on :3000
cd frontend && pnpm app:dev
```

Backend GraphQL is at http://localhost:8080/graphql, frontend at http://localhost:3000. For the
full workflow, `bootRun` configuration (`.env.properties`), GraphQL codegen and the Windows
`RUN_MODE` caveats see:

- [docker-compose/README.md](./docker-compose/README.md#from-sources-active-development-fast-inner-loop):
  sources default and the Windows `RUN_MODE` caveat
- [backend/app/README.md](./backend/app/README.md#local-development-bootrun): `bootRun` config
- [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md): the `pnpm dev` / `pnpm app:dev` scheme and GraphQL codegen
